# Week 1

## review
Dynamic arrays vs Automatic Arrays: 
- Automatic arrays are allocated when a function starts, and freed when the function ends. All steps are done by the compiler
- Dynamic arrays are allocated and free by the user. 
- Automatic arrays are constants, dynamics are variables. 

Debugging: 
Firstly, compile with: 
```
gcc -Wall -g -o program program.c
```
Then: 
```
valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes ./program
```
Debugging prinicples: 
1. No warnings
2. Clean valgrind report
3. first debug with small, simple input 

### Shell Commands
- argc, argv: 
```
./program Brisbane cities.csv
```
- argc = 3 in this scenario, with argv[2] = cities.csv
```
./program Brisbane < cities.csv
```
- In the given code, argc = 2, and argv[1] = Brisbane, while cities.csv now can be accessed as the stdin file. 
```
FILE *fptr = stdin; // ALready points to the file name.
```
